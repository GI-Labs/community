# Vote Simulation ...

### Electronic Vote is a powerful group decision tools

At [Gradual Quanta][1], we implemented the first [eco-social][2]
voting platform on blockchain that doesn't consume lot's of energy
to secure the ledger (it uses [Mychelium][my] blockchain)

Our approach is simple, we run a permissionned ledger so any [Sybil attack][3]
cannot temper the vote's results without being exposed to everyone.

## Why a simulation ?

By running a vote simulation, you can predict the result and see by yourself
if there is biases in the system. So at least you can make sure you
adjust your vote for the best outcome before the closing time.

So with our simulation you can see who might the winner, so you can
correct your vote if necessary to avoid a political catastrophy!

and make your vote "useful"

 Trust Metrics :

  "I, person A, vouch for the fact that person B is a member of this group"

  One such approach is the Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI [6]. Briefly,
  a PKI consists of variousCertificationAuthorities(or CA’s) that
  issuecertificatesasserting a binding between a name and a public
  key. PKI’s suffer fromtwo fundamental problems: the lack of useful
  meaning in the PKI’s underlying namespace, and the question of whichCA
  to trust. Actual implementations of CA’s have proved themselves not
  worthy of absolute trust. Further, asthe number of CA’s deployed
  scales up, the risk of any one of them being compromised scales
  accordingly. In partbecause of these two problems, PKI’s have met
  with limited success at best.
